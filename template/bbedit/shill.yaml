name: "BBEdit / TextWrangler"
description: |
    This plist file (original from Captain Barmy) is a "codeless language module" which works with
    BBEdit 8.x and TextWrangler 2.x. It support syntax highlighting. The update for 1.13
    also updates BBLMLanguageCode to LLSL as advised by Herbert Hoggard.

    BBEdit also supports a binary module, which can enable the function popup
    and more highlighting. I'll post one of those if I can figure it out.
